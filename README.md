# School Jenga

A game that takes in a data formatted in JSON, cointaining students ids, grades, subjects, domains and other class and subject descriptions to build a jenga tower based on their knowledge.

## Jenga tower

Each student has its own tower, it is composed of stone, wood and glass pieces representing the knowledge level on each subject:

-Stone pieces: student has been tested and mastered the subject

-Wood pieces: student has done well in the subject, but needs to be tested

-Glass pieces: student needs to study the subject and go through tests

The purpose of the tower is to verify if the student is capable of going to more advanced subjects.

## Gameplay

Each tower can be tested for the students knowledge, where all the glass pieces are removed and gravity is applied on the tower. If it's still standing, the student passes, else they need to
reinforce their "glass" subjects.
